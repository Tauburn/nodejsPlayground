# nodejsPlayground

Just testing some css and things.

If you want to run this and see the project:

1. Download and run the correct binary for your system from here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Navigate to the serverTesting folder and in your terminal (I use gitbash), run > node server.js <
3. Go to your browser of choice and go to http://localhost:8080/index.htm (feel free to customise the port and things that's just where I've put it)
